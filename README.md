# gz - the Groundzero CLI

One small Rust binary for the whole Groundzero platform: lakehouse, SQL,
files, ETL jobs, notebooks, models, agents, and chat. No runtime to install,
no URLs to memorize.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sarvesh-GanesanW/gz-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sarvesh-GanesanW/gz-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both install to `~/.local/bin` (`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows),
verify the checksum, and fix up your `PATH`. macOS needs nothing extra;
Windows may show a one-time SmartScreen prompt (the binary isn't signed yet).

Prefer manual? Grab your platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Sarvesh-GanesanW/gz-cli/releases),
drop it on `PATH` as `gz`, run `gz --version`. From source:
`make install-local` (needs Rust 1.88+).

## Update

```bash
gz update          # self-update to the latest release (checksum-verified)
gz update --check  # just report whether an update exists
```

`gz update` fetches the newest release binary for your platform, verifies
its sha256 checksum, and swaps it in place — no reinstall, no PATH changes.

## Setup

```bash
gz configure            # prompts: client, site, domain (your web app is https://<site>.<client>.<domain>)
gz auth login           # username, password, and authenticator code
gz doctor               # checks every service and your sign-in
```

That's it. `gz auth login` signs in exactly like the web app (Cognito) and
reads the web app's own settings, so every service URL is found for you on
any environment. Sessions renew automatically; `gz auth logout` revokes
them. Override a single service only if you need to:

```bash
gz configure --service data=https://<gateway-url>
```

Tokens live in `~/.config/gz/config.toml`, readable only by you.
`gz auth mcp-token` prints a token for AI tools that speak MCP.

## Daily use

```bash
gz warehouse list
gz table describe prod analytics orders
gz sql run --sql @query.sql --wait --data @conn.json
gz fs ls --connection s3conn --prefix raw/2024/
gz jobs submit --data @job.json
gz jobs logs --job nightly-etl
gz notebooks list 7
gz models list-all
gz agents list
gz projects list
gz projects jobs myproject
gz designer datasets
gz designer dashboards
gz workspaces list
gz connections list
gz schedules executions
gz permissions api-key list <user>
gz jobs run <project> <job> --compute <id> --rte <image> --follow
gz rte images
gz chat conversations
```

`--output table|json|yaml` on everything (`--json` for scripts).
Writes take `--data @file.json`; secrets belong in files or stdin (`@-`),
never on the command line. `gz request <service> <method> <path>` hits any
endpoint the shortcuts don't cover yet.

`conn.json` for SQL looks like this:

```json
{
  "connectionConfig": {"config": {"userName": "u", "password": "p", "warehouseName": "prod"}},
  "computeId": 6
}
```

## Assistant (`gz code`)

`gz code` is Groundzero chat that can work on the folder you run it in:
read and search files, edit them, and run commands — always with your
permission.

```bash
cd my-project
gz code                          # interactive session
gz code "why does the build fail?" --yes-reads   # one question, reads pre-approved
gz code -c <conversation-id>     # continue a conversation
```

- Reads and searches ask once per folder; every edit shows its diff first;
  every command asks (answer `a` to allow it for the session).
- Everything stays inside the starting folder; secrets (`.env*`, keys,
  `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, git credentials) are always blocked.
- Each tool call is logged (tool, target, decision — never contents) to
  `~/.config/gz/audit.log`.
- `Ctrl+C` stops the current answer; `/new` starts over; `/exit` quits.

**Scripts (programmatic tool calling).** For work that would take many tool
calls — scanning a codebase, counting, batch edits — the assistant can write
one short Python or Node script that calls the file tools as functions and
prints only the answer. You see the full script and approve it first (`a`
allows scripts for the session); it then runs in the folder with `python3` or
`node`. Inside, `import gz` (Python) or `require("gz")` (Node) gives
`read_file`, `list_directory`, `find_files`, `search_files`, `edit_file`, and
`write_file` — the same sandbox, secret blocking, and audit log as single
calls, and every edit still shows its diff unless you allow all edits from
that script. Scripts can't run commands through `gz`, stop after 120 s by
default, and are limited to 500 helper calls.

Needs a chat backend with client tools enabled (`CHAT_CLIENT_TOOLS_ENABLED`).

## TUI

`gz tui` opens a full-screen console mirroring the app: Chat, Lakehouse,
DE/ML, Agents, Designer, Workspaces, Connections, Files, Catalog, Schedules.

- `↑↓` move through the sidebar tree, `→`/`Enter` open, `←` back, `Tab`
  switches sidebar ↔ content, `Ctrl+K` (or `:`) jumps anywhere.
- Chat: pick a conversation or press `n`, type, `Enter` sends, replies
  stream in with Markdown (tables, code, lists) rendered; `Esc` cancels.
- Tables: `/` filters live, `[` `]` scroll columns, `r` reloads.
- Mouse clicks and scrolling work; `?` shows every key; `q` quits.

## Reference

`gz --help` lists every command; each group has its own help
(`gz sql --help`). Shell completions: `gz completion bash|zsh|fish`.

| Service key | What it talks to              | URL source          |
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| lakehouse   | warehouses, tables, backups   | derived             |
| etl         | jobs, runs, lineage           | derived             |
| files       | file manager                  | derived             |
| agents      | agent builder API             | derived             |
| chat, auth  | chat, MCP tokens              | derived             |
| data, mlops, etlprojects, datasets, dashboards, visualizations, filters, workspaces, schedules, rtes, permissions, connections, admin, adminqueries, notifications, logexports | gateway APIs | read from the web app at `gz auth login` |

Config layers: flags beat env (`GZ_PROFILE`, `GZ_TOKEN`, `GZ_CLIENT`,
`GZ_SITE`, `GZ_DOMAIN`) beat the config file.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                   | Fix                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `no client configured`    | run `gz configure`                               |
| `401/403` from a provider | `gz auth login`; check `gz auth status`          |
| install script 404s       | releases page directly, or check your network    |
| `gz auth mcp-token` port busy | `--port 0` picks a free port                  |
| a service shows ✗ in `gz doctor` | check VPN/network; re-run `gz auth login` |

## Development

```bash
make build | make test | make check   # check = fmt + clippy -D warnings
make install-local
```

Releases: push a `v*` tag and CI builds Linux, macOS (ARM + Intel), and
Windows, attaches them with checksums, and generates notes.
